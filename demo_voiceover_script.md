**(0:00 - 0:15) [SCENE: Dashboard Landing Page - Empty or Intro]**
**VOICE:**
"In the world of e-commerce, a five-star rating is no longer enough. It’s static, it’s manipulatable, and frankly, it’s broken. Welcome to **TRUSTRA**, the Temporal Reputation Intelligence System. We don't just measure ratings; we measure *Trust* as a living, breathing metric."

**(0:15 - 0:30) [SCENE: Select 'Vora, Kulkarni and Sahota' (High Score)]**
**VOICE:**
"Let's look at a legitimate seller. TRUSTRA aggregates data across three dimensions: Behavioral Consistency, Semantic Authenticity, and Network Health. Here, you see a Trust Score of **780**. The neon green glow and the 'Excellent' status aren't just for show—they represent a seller with low volatility and organic buyer relationships."

**(0:30 - 0:45) [SCENE: Hover over Risk Radar & Timeline]**
**VOICE:**
"Our **Risk Radar** breaks down the score. Unlike simple averages, we analyze shipping velocity, dispute rates, and identity verification in real-time. The **Trust Timeline** below proves that this reputation wasn't built overnight—it’s a consistent vector over time."

**(0:45 - 1:00) [SCENE: Select 'FRAUD_SUSPECT_LTD' (Red Score)]**
**VOICE:**
"But what about the threats? Here is a seller detected by our system. To the naked eye, they might look fine. But TRUSTRA’s **Graph Engine** has flagged them. Look at the **Fraud Cluster** panel. We used `NetworkX` algorithms to detect a ring of bot accounts artificially inflating this seller's score."

**(1:00 - 1:15) [SCENE: Technical Impact / Code Overlay or Architecture Diagram if available]**
**VOICE:**
"Under the hood, TRUSTRA is powered by a microservices architecture. A Node.js gateway orchestrates traffic between a Python ML engine for statistical modeling and a dedicated Graph Service for collusion detection. All updates are pushed to this Next.js frontend via WebSockets."

**(1:15 - 1:30) [SCENE: Back to Dashboard, Refresh Button]**
**VOICE:**
"We built TRUSTRA for Web Weaver 2026 to solve a fundamental problem of the digital age. We believe trust shouldn't be a guess—it should be intelligence. Thank you."

**💡 Tips for Recording:**
*   **Pace:** Speak at a moderate, conversational pace.
*   **Sync:** Verify the "Bot Ring" or "Graph Intelligence" panel actually shows a negative value for the fraud seller during that segment.
*   **Emphasis:** Emphasize words like "Temporal", "Intelligence", and "Graph Engine".
